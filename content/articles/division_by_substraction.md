## On the inexistance of multiplication and division as primary operations

computers can’t multiply. they add or substract e.g. let us divide 10/3
by using substraction. we’ll deduce 3 from 10 on and on

```10/3``` is ```3 1/3```

```
count      step
10
7           +1
4           +1
1           +1
```

where 1 is the remainder

3 steps with remainder 1

same for multiplication 

mechanical computers were based on this principle as well as modern ones
