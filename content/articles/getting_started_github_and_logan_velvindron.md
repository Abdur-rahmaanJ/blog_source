Github is a hub for git repositories. It provides a cool interface with lots of social elements like issues, follows, discover and watch. Due to the huge number of projects hosted there, it is a place not to be missed in the Open Source world. This article is intended to be an overview of some features as well as the story of how i got started and **is not a complete guide**.

## When Mr. Logan Cares

It was some years ago, i was very much interested in Python but not in git or github. I had an account but it was not active. I found the Github interface confusing, it was brewing with buttons and labels. I simply did not care. One day Mr. Loganaden phoned me, he basically convinced me to start using github. I told him it was very confusing but he encouraged me to try, telling me it was easy etc in a convincing way. And i tried to use it. At the start i was just using the elements without git. Uploading files, deleting and renaming including adding folders all by the github interface. When the time came for more complex actions, i learnt git and started using it. But Mr. Logan had to think of me first.

## What is Git?

Git is a Version Control System which allows any document to be tracked for changes. If you want to revert to a previous version of a document you can. It is not necessary to use it in coding projects, you can track office documents as well as shopping lists for example. Then git also allows multiple people collaborating on a project at the same time. It groups changes under a label/name called branch so that you can remove changes by branch. A change is called a commit. A diff short for difference is called a patch. Committing a patch means modifying a file.
